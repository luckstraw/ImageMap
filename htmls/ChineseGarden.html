            <h1>Chinese Garden</h1>
            <p>
                An ornate Chinese-style gate, carved with swirling dragons, 
                leads you into this whimsical garden which looks like it 
                has been transported from old Peking. Along the lagoon 
                constructed to simulate a small lake, are pagodas and 
                gazebos that are set off by red pillars and green-tiled 
                roofs and decorated with a profusion of mythical figures.
