            <h1>National Planetarium</h1>
            <p>
                The National Planetarium was established to disseminate astronomical 
                information through various platforms and technology, such as full-dome 
                digital and mobile planetarium shows, lectures, demonstrations, 
                exhibitions, and actual celestial observations.
                <br>
                The gallery at the National Planetarium entitled “Filipino Life Guided 
                by Skies” focuses not only in modern astronomy but primarily in 
                ethnoastronomy practices used by our Filipino cultural communities.  
                This ethnoastronomy exhibition is divided into six sections, namely: 
                The Cosmic Timeline, Cultural Astronomy, Philippine Night Sky, 
                Time Reckoning, Farming and Hunting, and Seafaring and Navigation
