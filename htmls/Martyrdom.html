            <h1>Martyrdom of Dr. Jose P. Rizal</h1>
            <p>
                Dr. Jos√© Rizal was executed on the morning of December 30, 1896, 
                in what was then called Bagumbayan (now referred to as Luneta). 
                He was found guilty and publicly executed by a firing squad 
                in Manila. His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no 
                alternative to independence from Spain
