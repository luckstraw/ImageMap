                The Rizal Monument is a memorial in Rizal Park in Manila, 
                Philippines built to commemorate the executed Filipino 
                nationalist, José Rizal. The monument consists of a standing 
                bronze sculpture of Rizal, with an obelisk, set on a 
                stone base within which his remains are interred, holding 
                his 2 famous novels "El Filibusterismo and Noli Me Tangere". 
                A plaque on the pedestal's front reads: "To the memory of 
                José Rizal, patriot and martyr, executed on Bagumbayan Field 
                December 30 1896. This monument is dedicated by the people 
                of the Philippine Islands."
