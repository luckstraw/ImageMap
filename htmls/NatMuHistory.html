            <p>
                The National Museum of Natural History houses 12 permanent 
                galleries that exhibit the rich biological and geological 
                diversity of the Philippines. It includes creatively curated 
                displays of botanical, zoological, and geological specimens 
                that represent our unique natural history. Situated at the 
                center of the museum is a “Tree of Life” structure that proudly 
                connects all the unique ecosystems in the Philippines, 
                from our magnificent mountain ridges to the outstanding 
                marine reefs.
